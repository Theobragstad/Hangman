# Hangman
Basic terminal-based hangman game that I challenged myself to make in approximately one hour.

**Features**:
- Save scores and view past saved scores
- Guess a hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn!
- Get a hint if you're having trouble.
- Continue playing seamlessly after you lose or guess a word.
___

- Minor hint issue  
- Minor guess count issue
