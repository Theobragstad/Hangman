# hangman
Very simple terminal-based hangman game that I challenged myself to make in approximately an hour.

Compile: g++ -std=c++11 hangman.cpp  
Run: ./a.out


Ideas for future improvements:  
-multiple difficulty levels (number of guesses/hints, word difficulties)  
-reduce the number of variables used in the game  
-fix minor hint issue  
-fix minor guess count issue
