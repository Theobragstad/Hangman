# Hangman
Basic terminal-based hangman game that I challenged myself to make in approximately one hour.

**Features**:
- Save scores and view past saved scores
- Guess a hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn!
- Get a hint if you're having trouble.
- Continue playing seamlessly after you lose or guess a word.

**Ideas for future improvement**:
- Multiple difficulty levels 
  - Number of guesses/hints
  - Word difficulties
- Refactor code
- Minor hint issue  
- Minor guess count issue
