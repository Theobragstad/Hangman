Simple terminal-based hangman game that I challenged myself to make in approximately one hour.

Compile: g++ -std=c++11 hangman.cpp  
Run: ./a.out

Future improvements:  
- [ ] multiple difficulty levels (number of guesses/hints, word difficulties)  
- [ ] refactor code
- [ ] minor hint issue  
- [ ] minor guess count issue
