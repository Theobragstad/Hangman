#### Hangman
Terminal-based hangman game that I challenged myself to make in approximately one hour

Features:
- Save scores and view previously saved scores
- Guess a hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn
- Get a hint if you're stuck
- Play again after you lose or guess a word
<br>

How to run:
- Download or clone this repository  
- Compile: g++ -std=c++20 hangman.cpp  
- Run: ./a.out
<br>

Improvement ideas  
- [ ] Multiple difficulty levels 
  - [ ] Number of guesses/hints
  - [ ] Word difficulties
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Minor hint issue  
- [ ] Minor guess count issue
